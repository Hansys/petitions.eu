Thank you for using Petities.nl! You can now log in, finish your petition and open it up for signatures. But please first follow this link

        confirmlink

        as confirmation. We then know we can reach you on $e-mailadres$. With $e-mailadres$ and $password$ you can log in at https://petities.nl/login

        Please make sure that this is your daily, normal e-mail address where we can send important e-mail about your petition to.

        If you prefer not to share $e-mailadres$ with signatories you can fill in, now or later, an extra address next to the petition itself. At http://deds.nl you can for example get a free e-mail address. The address next to the petition only shows up in e-mails to signatories. The address next to the petition only shows up in e-mails to signatories, not on the web. This is to prevent unwanted e-mail.
