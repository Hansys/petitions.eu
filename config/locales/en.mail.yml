Please make sure that this is your daily, normal e-mail address where we can send important e-mail about your petition to.

If you prefer not to share $e-mailadres$ with signatories you can fill in, now or later, an extra address next to the petition itself. At http://deds.nl you can for example get a free e-mail address. The address next to the petition only shows up in e-mails to signatories. The address next to the petition only shows up in e-mails to signatories, not on the web. This is to prevent unwanted e-mail.

Do you need help for your petition, please check our handbook at http://handboek.petities.nl

As petitioner you can reach us by e-mail at webmaster@petities.nl for technical questions. You can also send up to three e-mails to the signatories. Just e-mail us the text without attachments.
