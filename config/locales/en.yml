      <p>Petities.nl and Petitions.eu belong to the stichting Petities.nl, on the web <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051017052754/http://petities.nl/">since 1 May 2005.</a> Our aim is to make it easier for Dutch citizens to sign or start a petition which should be answered. Since 16 June 2008 the recipients of petitions can open a desk in this website to receive and answer petitions.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This service is made possible by professional volunteers, <a href="http://www.digitalepioniers.nl/projecten/Petities-nl/59">subsidies</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101209065053/http://www.burgerlink.nl/eparticipatie/instrumenten-eparticipatie/Petities-nl2.xml">temporary professional support</a> and donations. Petities.nl is recognised by the Dutch Tax Authority as <a href="http://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/business/other_subjects/public_benefit_organisations/">a Public Benefit Organisation</a>.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The foundation is erected in February 2004 by ReindeR Rustema, Arjan Widlak and Michiel Leenaars and can be found in the register of the Chamber of Commerce <a href="https://server.db.kvk.nl/TST-BIN/ZS/ZSWWW01@?TYPE=NDNR&NDNR=34206249&NSDN=&submit=">with number 34206249</a>. The board now consists of ReindeR Rustema, Johan Kok, Liesbeth Dillo and Michiel Leenaars.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Technically the site is made possible by the volunteers of the 'Open Domein' association. From them you can get a <a href="http://deds.nl">free e-mailadres without advertising with respect for your privacy</a>. Then you can also <a href="http://opendomein.nl/lidmaatschap/">become member (for â‚¬15 per year)</a> if you appreciate the technical support of this kind of internet projects.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>From 2011 onwards the hosting is done by internetprovider <a href="https://www.xs4all.nl/welcome-to-xs4all.htm">XS4ALL</a> because XS4ALL supports "initiatives aimed at the free exchange of information, democracy, privacy and the innovative use of the internet." The servers of Open Domein find shelter at XS4ALL because of that. The certificates for the secure communication with petities.nl are provided by <a href="https://www.xolphin.nl/Xolphin">Xolphin SSL Certificaten</a>. The number +31207854412 and the telephone exchange behind it by <a href="http://callvoip.nl/">CallVOIP</a>.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.netdem.nl">Netwerk Democratie</a>, the platform voor democratic innovation, supports Petities.nl with office space amongst others.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Our annual report is available <a href="http://jaarverslag.petities.nl">in Dutch</a>.</p>&#13;

      question01:
        answer: Petities.nl aims to overcome the usual shortcomings of online petitions, we ask&#58;<br>&#149; to address each petition to a recipient in the position to change matters as requested<br>&#149; to have a petitioner responsible as a spokesperson and contact about the petition; no anonymous petitions without someone responsible<br>&#149; petitions to deal with the public interest, no consumer issues<br>&#149; for constructive petitions by requiring a sender and clear observation and demand<br>&#149; preventing spam for signatories.<br>In general we want to enable and improve the constitutional right to petition.  
        title: Online petitions are pointless I am told. Why is Petities.nl different?
      question02:
        answer: You can not sign anonymously. You can sign without showing your name publicly. When you sign you should tick a checkbox to allow your name to be shown publicly. When you do not allow this, only three persons can see your name&#58;<br>&#149; The recipient of the petition, usually the government.<br>&#149; The petitioner, who manages the petition.<br>&#149; Petities.nl, who manages the website. You can always tick or empty this checkbox.
        title: Why are anonymous signatures allowed?
      question03:
        answer: Degene die de petitie uiteindelijk ontvangt krijgt een uitdraai van uw gegevens om te controleren. In theorie kunt u persoonlijk door een politicus of beleidsambtenaar benaderd worden als ze gegronde vermoedens hebben dat ze waardevolle toelichting op de petitie kunnen krijgen op die manier. In de praktijk wordt er alleen met de petitionaris gesproken, als woordvoerder van alle ondertekenaars. De ontvanger van een petitie kan geen mailing versturen naar de lijst ondertekenaars, want de <a href="https://www.cbpweb.nl/">Wet op de Bescherming Persoonsgegevens</a> verhindert dat. Deze database is immers niet met die bedoeling aangelegd, dus dat mag niet. De webmaster en de systeembeheerder van petities.nl hebben toegang tot alle gegevens. De Stichting Petities.nl wil zich onderscheiden van concurrende aktiesites door de betrouwbaarheid en neutraliteit. We vallen onder de Nederlandse wetgeving en staan op servers in Nederland bij een non-profit organisatie die niet te koop is. Gegevens die niet gebruikt zijn worden zelfs actief gewist (niets bewaren is altijd het veiligst in dit verband). De petitionaris heeft gedurende de looptijd van de petitie geen toegang tot uw gegevens en krijgt na de 'sluiting' van de petitie alleen toegang tot de naam-titel-geboortedatum-woonplaats gegevens om te overhandigen. Dit is de lijst inclusief de op de website onzichtbare ondertekenaars. Deze lijst mag dus niet gepubliceerd worden (beschermd door de Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens) en mag alleen overhandigd worden om te worden gecontroleerd op echtheid. En om indruk te maken natuurlijk! Volksvertegenwoordigers weten als geen ander hoe moeilijk het is om iemand ergens uit vrije wil ergens voor te laten tekenen...

    opinionpiece:
      descr: A petition gets most signatures from allies who are already convinced by the need for change. But most are not! If they know about the petition at all. With opinion piece in the newspaper or online you can both inform and convince people. This text is usually more pleasant to read than a petition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To write such a piece is not difficult&#58; it is all about the opinion supported by arguments. Send your piece to a newspaper or a website accepting contributions from others. You can also write an opinion piece to draw attention to someone else's petition. Do not forget the call to sign the petition!

      <p>Petities.nl only uses cookies during your visit to the site, is accessible to all and can be visited anonymously. We record the internet adresses the website is served to. We use this information only to improve the website.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As <a href="wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0011468/">the law (in Dutch)</a> prescribes, all personal data are only purposefully used; for the purpose you have supplied them: the recipient of a petition gets a copy of the list of signatories to verify or to get an overview of their constituency. The recipient may also personally contact you, but in practise the recipient will only communicate with the lead petitioner as spokesperson for all signatories.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When you sign anonimously your peronsal data disappear (except the timestamp of your signature) from the database once the petition is answered. If you indicated your public support to a petition your name, place of residence and title/description remain in the database to be served on the web. Would you like to not be visible on the web anymore, you can change this by following the link in the e-mail you received to confirm your signature (see <a href="/help/algemeen">help</a> if you do not have the link anymore). To disappear from the search results in search engines it might take up to a week.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When you e-mail the webmaster your e-mail address is only used for correspondence regarding that question, complaint or remark. You do not receive impersonal information (like a newsletter), unless you <a href="http://service.opendomein.nl/mailman/listinfo/nieuws/">subscribe yourself to the newsletter.</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When you sign a petition, you will always receive three e-mails from info@petities.nl:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>to confirm your signature, within minutes up to a day after your signature</li>
        <li>to announce the closing and hand over of the petition, weeks or months after your signature</li>
        <li>to let you know the result of the petition, within six weeks after the hand over of the petition.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>On top of that, the petitioner can have petities.nl e-mail about the progress to those who indicated willingness to receive such e-mails. You can indicate you do not want this by following the link from the first e-mail, with which you confirmed your signature. You can request this e-mail from <a href="/help/algemeen">help</a>.</p>
