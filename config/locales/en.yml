      <p>Petities.nl and Petitions.eu belong to the stichting Petities.nl, on the web <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051017052754/http://petities.nl/">since 1 May 2005.</a> Our aim is to make it easier for Dutch citizens to sign or start a petition which should be answered. Since 16 June 2008 the recipients of petitions can open a desk in this website to receive and answer petitions.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This service is made possible by professional volunteers, <a href="http://www.digitalepioniers.nl/projecten/Petities-nl/59">subsidies</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101209065053/http://www.burgerlink.nl/eparticipatie/instrumenten-eparticipatie/Petities-nl2.xml">temporary professional support</a> and donations. Petities.nl is recognised by the Dutch Tax Authority as <a href="http://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/business/other_subjects/public_benefit_organisations/">a Public Benefit Organisation</a>.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The foundation is erected in February 2004 by ReindeR Rustema, Arjan Widlak and Michiel Leenaars and can be found in the register of the Chamber of Commerce <a href="https://server.db.kvk.nl/TST-BIN/ZS/ZSWWW01@?TYPE=NDNR&NDNR=34206249&NSDN=&submit=">with number 34206249</a>. The board now consists of ReindeR Rustema, Johan Kok, Liesbeth Dillo and Michiel Leenaars.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Technically the site is made possible by the volunteers of the 'Open Domein' association. From them you can get a <a href="http://deds.nl">free e-mailadres without advertising with respect for your privacy</a>. Then you can also <a href="http://opendomein.nl/lidmaatschap/">become member (for â‚¬15 per year)</a> if you appreciate the technical support of this kind of internet projects.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>From 2011 onwards the hosting is done by internetprovider <a href="https://www.xs4all.nl/welcome-to-xs4all.htm">XS4ALL</a> because XS4ALL supports "initiatives aimed at the free exchange of information, democracy, privacy and the innovative use of the internet." The servers of Open Domein find shelter at XS4ALL because of that. The certificates for the secure communication with petities.nl are provided by <a href="https://www.xolphin.nl/Xolphin">Xolphin SSL Certificaten</a>. The number +31207854412 and the telephone exchange behind it by <a href="http://callvoip.nl/">CallVOIP</a>.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.netdem.nl">Netwerk Democratie</a>, the platform voor democratic innovation, supports Petities.nl with office space amongst others.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Our annual report is available <a href="http://jaarverslag.petities.nl">in Dutch</a>.</p>&#13;

      <p>Petities.nl only uses cookies during your visit to the site, is accessible to all and can be visited anonymously. We record the internet adresses the website is served to. We use this information only to improve the website.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As <a href="wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0011468/">the law (in Dutch)</a> prescribes, all personal data are only purposefully used; for the purpose you have supplied them: the recipient of a petition gets a copy of the list of signatories to verify or to get an overview of their constituency. The recipient may also personally contact you, but in practise the recipient will only communicate with the lead petitioner as spokesperson for all signatories.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When you sign anonimously your peronsal data disappear (except the timestamp of your signature) from the database once the petition is answered. If you indicated your public support to a petition your name, place of residence and title/description remain in the database to be served on the web. Would you like to not be visible on the web anymore, you can change this by following the link in the e-mail you received to confirm your signature (see <a href="/help/algemeen">help</a> if you do not have the link anymore). To disappear from the search results in search engines it might take up to a week.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When you e-mail the webmaster your e-mail address is only used for correspondence regarding that question, complaint or remark. You do not receive impersonal information (like a newsletter), unless you <a href="http://service.opendomein.nl/mailman/listinfo/nieuws/">subscribe yourself to the newsletter.</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When you sign a petition, you will always receive three e-mails from info@petities.nl:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>to confirm your signature, within minutes up to a day after your signature</li>
        <li>to announce the closing and hand over of the petition, weeks or months after your signature</li>
        <li>to let you know the result of the petition, within six weeks after the hand over of the petition.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>On top of that, the petitioner can have petities.nl e-mail about the progress to those who indicated willingness to receive such e-mails. You can indicate you do not want this by following the link from the first e-mail, with which you confirmed your signature. You can request this e-mail from <a href="/help/algemeen">help</a>.</p>
